# Algorithms and Data Structures

Various algorithms and datastructures written in Java. I started this mostly as a fun way to explore how various
data structures and algorithms work. I'm reading through an Algorithms and Data Structures textbook that shows
various implementations and trying them out. Feel free to pick this code up if you'd like!
